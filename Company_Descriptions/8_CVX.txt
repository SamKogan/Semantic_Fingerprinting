Summary Description of Chevron 
Chevron Corporation,* a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in fully integrated petroleum operations, chemicals operations, mining activities, power generation and energy services. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids project. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. 
     A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented on pages E-4 and E-5. As of December 31, 2012, Chevron had approximately 62,000 employees (including about 3,700 service station employees). Approximately 31,000 employees (including about 3,400 service station employees), or 50 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. 
 

Overview of Petroleum Industry 
 
Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. The members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are typically the world’s swing producers of crude oil and their production levels are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to 
 
other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. 
 
     Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets. 
 

Operating Environment 
 
Refer to pages FS-2 through FS-8 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company’s current business environment and outlook.

Chevron’s Strategic Direction 
 
Chevron’s primary objective is to create shareholder value and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream, the company’s strategies are to grow profitably in core areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the company’s equity natural gas resource base while growing a high-impact global natural gas business. In the downstream, the strategies are to improve returns and grow earnings across the value chain. The company also continues to utilize technology across all its businesses to differentiate performance, and to invest in profitable renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions.

Description of Business and Properties
The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects* in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2012, and assets as of the end of 2012 and 2011 — for the United States and the company’s international geographic areas — are in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-36. Similar comparative data for the company’s investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Notes 11 and 12 on pages FS-38 through FS-40.
 

Capital and Exploratory Expenditures 
 
Total expenditures for 2012 were $34.2 billion, including $2.1 billion for the company’s share of equity-affiliate expenditures. In 2011 and 2010, expenditures were $29.1 billion and $21.8 billion, respectively, including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of $1.7 billion in 2011 and $1.4 billion in 2010. 
 
     Of the $34.2 billion in expenditures for 2012, 89 percent, or $30.4 billion, was related to upstream activities. Approximately 89 and 87 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2011 and 2010, respectively. International upstream accounted for about 72 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2012, about 68 percent in 2011 and about 82 percent in 2010. These amounts exclude the acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc., in 2011. 
 
     In 2013, the company estimates capital and exploratory expenditures will be $36.7 billion, including $3.3 billion of spending by affiliates. Approximately 90 percent of the total, or $33 billion, is budgeted for exploration and production activities, with $25.5 billion, or about 70 percent, of this amount for projects outside the United States. 
 
     Refer also to a discussion of the company’s capital and exploratory expenditures on page FS-12. 

 
 
Upstream 
 
The table on the following page summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2012 and 2011 by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production was 2.610 million barrels per day, down about 2 percent from 2011. The decrease was mainly associated with normal field declines, the shut-in of the Frade Field in Brazil, and a major planned turnaround at the Tengizchevroil facilities in Kazakhstan. The start-up and ramp-up of several major capital projects — the Platong II natural gas project in Thailand, the Usan and Agbami 2 projects in Nigeria, and the Perdido, Tahiti 2 and Caesar/Tonga projects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico — partially offset the decrease in net production from 2011. Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on page FS-6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2010 through 2012 changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas. 
 
     The company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2013 will be approximately 2.650 million barrels per day based on an average Brent price of $112 per barrel in 2012. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas that may be imposed by OPEC, price effects on entitlement volumes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations, delays in project start-ups and ramp-ups, fluctuations in demand for natural gas in various markets, weather conditions that may shut in production, civil unrest, changing geopolitics, delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds, greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields, or other disruptions to operations. The longer-term outlook for production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and, for new, large-scale projects, the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. Refer to the “Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas,” beginning on page 9, for a discussion of the company’s major crude oil and natural gas development projects.

Delivery Commitments 
The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. 
     In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver to third parties 192 billion cubic feet of natural gas through 2015. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the company’s proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments include a variety of pricing terms, including both indexed and fixed-price contracts. 
 
     Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 791 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2013 through 2015 for operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company’s proved developed reserves in these countries.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas 
 
Chevron’s 2012 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page FS-2, are presented below. The comments include references to “total production” and “net production,” which are defined under “Production” in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-11. 
The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production and for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not the company’s share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned. 
 

     Chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the world’s major hydrocarbon basins. The company’s upstream strategy is to grow profitably in core areas, build new legacy positions and commercialize the company’s equity natural gas resource base while growing a high-impact global natural gas business. The map above indicates Chevron’s primary areas for exploration and production.
 
United States
 
Upstream activities in the United States are concentrated in California, the Gulf of Mexico, Colorado, Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Average net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2012 was 655,000 barrels per day. 
 
     In California, the company has significant production in the San Joaquin Valley. In 2012, net daily production averaged 163,000 barrels of crude oil, 70 million cubic feet of natural gas and 4,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs). Approximately 
 
86 percent of the crude oil production is considered heavy oil (typically with API gravity lower than 22 degrees). 
 

     During 2012, net daily production for the company’s combined interests in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and deepwater areas, and the onshore fields in the region, was 153,000 barrels of crude oil, 395 million cubic feet of natural gas and 16,000 barrels of NGLs. 
     Chevron was engaged in various exploration and development activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico during 2012. The Jack and St. Malo fields are located within 25 miles of each other and are being jointly developed. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field, a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field and a 50.7 percent interest in the production host facility. Both fields are company operated. Drilling operations progressed during 2012, with five of 10 planned wells drilled. At the end of 2012, project activities were more than 57 percent complete, with subsea and floating production unit installation activities expected in second-half 2013. The facility is planned to have a design capacity of 177,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development, which is estimated to have maximum total daily production of 94,000 barrels of oil equivalent, plus production from a nearby third-party field. Total project costs for the initial phase of development are estimated at $7.5 billion and start-up is expected in 2014. The fields have an estimated production life of 30 years. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. 
     In 2012, an evaluation of additional development opportunities was initiated for the Jack and St. Malo fields. Stage 2, the first phase of future development work, is expected to include four additional development wells, two each at the Jack and the St. Malo fields. Front-end engineering and design (FEED) activities are planned to begin in mid-2013. At the end of 2012, proved reserves had not been recognized for the Jack/St. Malo Stage 2 project.

First oil is anticipated in 2014, and maximum total daily production is expected to reach 40,000 to 45,000 barrels of oil-equivalent. The field has an estimated production life of 25 years. The initial recognition of proved reserves for the project occurred in 2012. 
 
     Chevron has a 20.3 percent nonoperated working interest in the Caesar and Tonga area. First production occurred in first quarter 2012, and maximum total daily production reached about 62,000 barrels of oil-equivalent by year-end 2012. Drilling operations on the fourth development well concluded in early 2013, and the well is expected to commence production in second quarter 2013. 
     The company has a 15.6 percent nonoperated working interest in the Mad Dog II Project. FEED commenced in second quarter 2012 and a final investment decision is expected in 2014. The project includes the construction and installation of a new production and drilling spar facility and is expected to add incremental maximum total daily production of 120,000 to 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent. At the end of 2012, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project. 
     In 2012, Chevron signed commercial agreements for the Stampede project allowing for the joint development of the Knotty Head and Pony fields. Chevron holds a 20 percent nonoperated working interest in this joint development. The project is expected to enter FEED by mid-2013. At the end of 2012, proved reserves had not been recognized for this project. 
     Deepwater exploration activities in 2012 included participation in three exploratory wells — one appraisal and two wildcats. Drilling began on an appraisal well at the 
 
43.8 percent-owned and operated Moccasin discovery in fourth quarter 2012. Drilling activities were placed on hold in early 2013 for equipment repair and are expected to resume later this year. Moccasin and the 55 percent-owned and operated Buckskin discovery, located 12 miles apart, could be jointly developed upon the successful completion of additional appraisal drilling planned for 2013. A second Coronado wildcat well began drilling in second quarter 2012, targeting the lower Tertiary Wilcox formation. Drilling was completed in February 2013, and the results are under evaluation. Chevron also had a 20 percent nonoperated working interest in the Hummer Shallow wildcat well. 
     Chevron added 15 leases to the deepwater portfolio as a result of awards from the central Gulf of Mexico lease sale in mid-2012. In addition, Chevron submitted the highest bids on 28 additional deepwater leases at the western Gulf of Mexico lease sale in late 2012. 
     Besides the activities connected with development and exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico, the company also has contracted liquefied natural gas (LNG) offloading, storage and regasification capacity at the Sabine Pass LNG facility and natural gas transportation capacity in a third-party pipeline system connecting the terminal to the U.S. natural gas pipeline grid.

The development drilling program also progressed during 2012.
     Chevron has signed binding, long-term LNG Sales and Purchase Agreements with six Asian customers for delivery of about 4.8 million metric tons of LNG per year, which brings delivery commitments to about 65 percent of Chevron’s share of LNG from this project. Discussions continue with potential customers to increase long-term sales to 85 percent of Chevron’s net LNG offtake. Chevron also has binding long-term agreements for delivery of about 65 million cubic feet per day of natural gas to Western Australian natural gas consumers starting in 2015, and the company continues to market additional natural gas quantities from the Gorgon Project. 
     An expansion project to develop a fourth train at the Gorgon LNG facility is expected to enter FEED in late 2013. At the end of 2012, proved reserves had not been recognized for the fields associated with this project. 
     Chevron is the operator of the Wheatstone Project, which includes a two-train, 8.9 million-metric-ton-per-year LNG facility and a domestic gas plant located at Ashburton North, along the northwest coast of Australia. The company plans to supply natural gas to the facilities from three company-operated licenses, containing the Wheatstone Field and nearby Iago Field. Maximum total daily production from these and third-party fields is expected to be about 1.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 30,000 barrels of condensate. Start-up of the first train is expected in 2016. Total estimated project costs for the first phase of development are $29 billion. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. The project's estimated economic life exceeds 30 years from the time of start-up.
     In 2012, construction and fabrication activities progressed, with a focus on delivering site infrastructure and key components of the platform and subsea equipment. Chevron signed additional commercial agreements that decreased Chevron's interest in the offshore licenses to 80.2 percent and in the LNG facilities to 64.1 percent. The company also executed agreements with Asian customers for the delivery of additional volumes of LNG. As of year-end 2012, more than 80 percent of Chevron’s equity LNG offtake was covered under long-term agreements with customers in Asia. In addition, the company has begun marketing its equity share of natural gas of approximately 120 million cubic feet per day to Western Australia natural gas consumers.
     During 2012 and early 2013, the company announced seven natural gas discoveries in the Carnarvon Basin. These include natural gas discoveries at the 47.3 percent-owned and operated Pontus prospect in Block WA-37-L, the 50 percent-owned and operated Satyr prospect in Block WA-374-P, the 50 percent-owned and operated Pinhoe prospect in Block WA-383-P, the 50 percent-owned and operated Arnhem prospect in Block 
 
WA-364-P, and the 50 percent-owned and operated Kentish Knock South prospect in Block WA-365-P. These discoveries are expected to contribute to potential expansion opportunities at company-operated LNG facilities. 
     Chevron has a 16.7 percent nonoperated working interest in the North West Shelf (NWS) Venture in Western Australia. Daily net production from the project during 2012 averaged 20,000 barrels of crude oil and condensate, 428 million cubic feet of natural gas, and 4,000 barrels of LPG. Approximately 70 percent of the natural gas was sold in the form of LNG to major utilities in Asia, primarily under long-term contracts. The remaining natural gas was sold to the Western Australia domestic market. The concession for the NWS Venture expires in 2034. 
     The North Rankin 2 project continued to advance during 2012, with start-up expected in mid-2013. The project is designed to recover remaining low-pressure natural gas from the North Rankin and Perseus fields to meet gas supply needs and maintain NWS production capacity of about 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 39,000 barrels of condensate. Total estimated projects costs are $5.4 billion. Proved reserves have been recognized for the project. The project's estimated economic life exceeds 20 years from the time of start-up.
     In October 2012, the company exchanged its 16.7 percent interest in the East Browse leases and its 20 percent interest in the West Browse leases for financial consideration and a 33.3 percent interest in the WA-205-P and WA-42-R blocks in the Carnarvon Basin and now holds a 100 percent interest in these blocks, which contain the Clio and Acme fields. The company retains other nonoperated working interests ranging from 24.8 percent to 50 percent in three other blocks in the Browse Basin. In Block WA-274-P, drilling in the fourth quarter 2012 resulted in a natural gas discovery at the Crown prospect.
